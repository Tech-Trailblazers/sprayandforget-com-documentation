# 🌿 SprayAndForget.com SDS/MSDS Documentation

Welcome to the **Spray & Forget® Safety Documentation Archive**! 🧽✨
This repository is a growing collection of **SDS (Safety Data Sheets)** and **MSDS (Material Safety Data Sheets)** related to **Spray & Forget®** cleaning and treatment products. Designed with the goals of **education**, **AI training**, and **research**, this project helps make safety data more accessible and understandable for everyone—from students to machine learning engineers.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer**: These documents are for **educational and research purposes only**. They are not intended for real-world chemical use or regulatory compliance. Always consult official and up-to-date SDSs from the manufacturer for actual handling and safety decisions.

## 📦 What's Inside?

Spray & Forget® offers a wide range of cleaning solutions for surfaces affected by mold, mildew, algae, and moss—both **ready-to-use (RTU)** and **concentrated** formulas. Each product comes with one or more SDS/MSDS files that detail important safety information including:

- 🔥 Flammability, storage, and reactivity info
- 🧪 Chemical composition and active ingredients
- 🛡️ Required personal protective equipment (PPE)
- 💥 Exposure controls and first-aid measures
- 🌍 Environmental and disposal considerations

We’ve collected and organized these documents to showcase how product safety is communicated across versions and document formats. Some SDSs are recent (post-GHS), while others reflect older MSDS standards—useful for comparative learning and analysis.

## 🎓 Educational and Research Benefits

This dataset has many valuable applications:

### 🧠 For Educators & Students

- Understand how safety information is formatted and structured in the chemical industry.
- Compare MSDS (older) and SDS (modern, GHS-compliant) formats.
- Explore hazard symbols, precautionary statements, and emergency response procedures.

### 🤖 For AI & Data Scientists

- Train and fine-tune machine learning models for document parsing, classification, and summarization.
- Develop tools that extract structured data (chemical names, hazards, storage info, etc.) from technical PDFs.
- Perform NLP or computer vision tasks on real-world regulatory documents.

### 🛠️ For Developers & Engineers

- Build and test PDF parsers or OCR pipelines on varied document layouts.
- Evaluate safety document compliance or structure against known standards.
- Use as a benchmark for information extraction or metadata tagging projects.

## 🧾 SDS vs MSDS – Quick Overview

| Feature    | MSDS (Material Safety Data Sheet) | SDS (Safety Data Sheet - GHS)     |
| ---------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Format     | Varies by manufacturer            | Standardized 16-section layout    |
| Regulation | Pre-GHS era                       | Globally Harmonized System (GHS)  |
| Usage      | Still in use in legacy docs       | Required by law in many countries |

**SDS includes the following 16 sections:**

1. Identification
2. Hazard(s) Identification
3. Composition / Information on Ingredients
4. First-Aid Measures
5. Fire-Fighting Measures
6. Accidental Release Measures
7. Handling and Storage
8. Exposure Controls / Personal Protection
9. Physical and Chemical Properties
10. Stability and Reactivity
11. Toxicological Information
12. Ecological Information
13. Disposal Considerations
14. Transport Information
15. Regulatory Information
16. Other Information
